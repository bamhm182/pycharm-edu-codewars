<div class="markdown" id="description"><p>This kata is definitely harder than the first one. See the last one here: <a href="http://www.codewars.com/kata/the-unknown-but-known-variables-addition" target="_blank">http://www.codewars.com/kata/the-unknown-but-known-variables-addition</a></p>
<p>This one is a programming problem as well as a puzzle. And this is one of those annoying puzzles that is going to seem impossible, as the answer is not like a riddle, but something random some jerk over the internet came up with. But I have confidence you will solve it.</p>
<p>There will be a string input in this format:
<code>'a*b'</code></p>
<p>2 lower-case letters (a-z) seperated by a '*'</p>
<p>Return the product of the two variables. The product will always be a positive integer or 0.</p>
<p>There is one correct answer for a pair of variables.</p>
<p>I know the answers, it is your task to find out.</p>
<p>Once you crack the code for a couple of the pairs, you should have the answer for the rest.</p>
<p>It is like when you were in school doing math and you saw <code>"12 = c*b"</code> and you needed to find out what c and b were.</p>
<p>However you don't have a 12. You have an UnKNOWN there as well. Example:</p>
<p>X = a*b.</p>
<p>You don't know what X is, and you don't know what b is or a, but it is a puzzle and you will find out.</p>
<p>As part of this puzzle, there is two hints or clues on solving this. I won't tell you what the other one is. But the first is: <code>The key is in the title.</code></p>
<p>Given the input as a string - Return the product of the two variables as int.</p>
