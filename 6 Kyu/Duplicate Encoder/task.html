<div class="markdown" id="description"><p>The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is <code>"("</code> if that character appears only once in the original string, or <code>")"</code> if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<pre><code>"din"      =&gt;  "((("
"recede"   =&gt;  "()()()"
"Success"  =&gt;  ")())())"
"(( @"     =&gt;  "))((" </code></pre><p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read <code>"...It Should encode XXX"</code>, the <code>"XXX"</code> is the expected result, not the input!</p>
