<div class="markdown" id="description"><p>A traveling salesman has to visit clients. He got each client's address e.g. <code>"432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071"</code> as a list.</p>
<p>The basic zipcode format usually consists of two capital letters followed by a white space and five digits.
The list of clients to visit was given as a string of all addresses, each separated from the others by a comma, e.g. :</p>
<p><code>"123 Main Street St. Louisville OH 43071,432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071,786 High Street Pollocksville NY 56432"</code>.</p>
<p>To ease his travel he wants to group the list by zipcode.</p>
<h1 id="task">Task</h1>
<p>The function <code>travel</code> will take two parameters <code>r</code> (addresses' list of all clients' as a string) and <code>zipcode</code> and returns a string in the following format:</p>
<p><code>zipcode:street and town,street and town,.../house number,house number,...</code> </p>
<p>The street numbers must be in the same order as the streets where they belong.</p>
<p>If a given zipcode doesn't exist in the list of clients' addresses return <code>"zipcode:/"</code></p>
<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<pre><code>r = "123 Main Street St. Louisville OH 43071,432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071,786 High Street Pollocksville NY 56432"

travel(r, "OH 43071") --&gt; "OH 43071:Main Street St. Louisville,Main Long Road St. Louisville/123,432"

travel(r, "NY 56432") --&gt; "NY 56432:High Street Pollocksville/786"

travel(r, "NY 5643") --&gt; "NY 5643:/"</code></pre><h1 id="note-for-elixir">Note for Elixir:</h1>
<p>In Elixir the empty addresses' input is an empty <em>list</em>, not an empty string.</p>
<h1 id="note">Note:</h1>
<p>You can see a few addresses and zipcodes in the test cases.</p>
