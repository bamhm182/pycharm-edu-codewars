<div class="markdown" id="description"><p>We have an integer array with unique elements and we want to do the permutations that have an element fixed, in other words, these permutations should have a certain element at the same position than the original.</p>
<p>These permutations will be called: <strong>permutations with one fixed point</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's see an example with an array of four elements and we want the permutations that have a coincidence <strong>only at  index 0</strong>, so these permutations are (the permutations between parenthesis):</p>
<pre><code>arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
      (1, 3, 4, 2)
      (1, 4, 2, 3)
Two permutations matching with arr only at index 0</code></pre><p>Let's see the permutations of the same array with only one coincidence at index <strong>1</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
      (3, 2, 4, 1)
      (4, 2, 1, 3)
Two permutations matching with arr only at index 1</code></pre><p>Once again, let's see the permutations of the same array with only one coincidence at index <strong>2</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
      (2, 4, 3, 1)
      (4, 1, 3, 2)
Two permutations matching with arr only at index 2</code></pre><p>Finally, let's see the permutations of the same array with only one coincidence at index <strong>3</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
      (2, 3, 1, 4)
      (3, 1, 2, 4)
Two permutations matching with arr only at index 3</code></pre><p>For this array given above (arr) :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We conclude that we have 8 permutations with one fixed point (two at each index of arr).</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may do the same development for our array, <code>arr</code>, with two fixed points and we will get <code>6</code> permutations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are no permutations with coincidences only at three indexes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's good to know that the amount of permutations with no coincidences at all are <code>9</code>. See the kata <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/shuffle-it-up" target="_blank">Shuffle It Up!!</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the amount of fixed points is equal to the array length, there is only one permutation, the original array.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the amount of fixed points surpasses the length of the array, obvously, there are no permutations at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a function that receives the length of the array and the number of fixed points and may output the total amount of permutations for these constraints.</p>
<p>Features of the random tests:</p>
<pre><code>length of the array = l
number of fixed points = k
10 ≤ k ≤ l ≤ 9000</code></pre><p>See the example tests!
Enjoy it!!</p>
