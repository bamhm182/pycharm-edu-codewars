<div class="markdown" id="description"><p>My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because
each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list
which means he is the heaviest. </p>
<p>I am the one who establishes the list so I told him:
"Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list".
It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on
the sum of its digits. </p>
<p>For example <code>99</code> will have "weight" <code>18</code>, <code>100</code> will have "weight"
<code>1</code> so in the list <code>100</code> will come before <code>99</code>.
Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered
by "weights" of these numbers?</p>
<h1 id="example">Example:</h1>
<p><code>"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90"</code> ordered by numbers weights becomes:
<code>"100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"</code></p>
<p>When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings and not numbers:
<code>100</code> is before <code>180</code> because its "weight" (1) is less than the one of <code>180</code> (9)
and <code>180</code> is before <code>90</code> since, having the same "weight" (9),  it comes before as a <em>string</em>.</p>
<p>All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>it may happen that the input string have leading, trailing whitespaces and more than a unique whitespace between two consecutive numbers</li>
<li>Don't modify the input</li>
<li>For C: The result is freed.</li>
</ul>
